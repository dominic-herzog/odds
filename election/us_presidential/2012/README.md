# Exploiting Arbitrage Opportunities in Online Betting: Empirical Evidence from the 2012 U.S. Presidential Elections
# 
# Abstract. This paper addresses the observation of arbitrage opportunities across online betting markets and the empirical evidence of their exploitation. During the last 14 months prior to the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election, I extracted minute-by-minute odds from numerous bookmakers and betting exchanges. I show that persistent price disparities existed on the election outcomeâ€™s odds which allowed for implementing a risk-free investment strategy. By placing real investments, I was able to identify the actual costs and risks of this strategy and empirically prove that exploitable arbitrage opportunities exist in inter-market online betting.
